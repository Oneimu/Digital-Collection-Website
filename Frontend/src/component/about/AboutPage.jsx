            Julius Rosenwald is “the greatest donor you never heard of,” remarks
            Peter Ascoli in his biography of this unextraordinary,
            extra-ordinary man, who also happens to be his grandfather (cited
            Deutsch ix). Born in 1862, Rosenwald grew up in Springfield,
            Illinois, across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s home.. In 1895,
            Rosenwald and his brother in law Aaron Nussbaum purchased Roebuck’s
            half of Sears and Roebuck after he and his fellow founder parted
            ways - in 1903, Rosenwald bought Nussbaum out. The company made
            millions of dollars, and survives to this day - well known to many
            scholars of American history and culture. But what of Julius
            Rosenwald, the modest and relatively private businessman whose name
            was never part of the company nomenclature?

            Owing to his Jewish roots, Rosenwald explained, he felt a connection
            to the discrimination faced by African Americans in the United
            States. This had been bolstered by his reading of Booker T.
            Washington’s Up From Slavery. After being introduced to Washington
            at a fundraising event for a Black YMCA, the two forged a
            partnership based on improving the condition of African Americans,
            particularly in the field of education. An “experiment” was launched
            to build six model schoolhouses in Macon County, Alabama.
